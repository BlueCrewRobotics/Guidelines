# Guidelines
The guidelines for software development with the Blue Crew Robotics Team

### Important rules:
  - When reviewing someones code be respectful
  - If you do not know what the code is doing: 1) read the comments/documentation 2) message the dev on slack 
  - You must explain how to use your code in clean, neat documentation.
  - Know what your are talking about when reviewing code! 
  
  
### Code Formatting Guidelines:
  - A function should be named exactly what it does (e.g. liftMechanism() or pwmMotor(int speed)).
  - Don't ever give a function an arbitrary name (e.g. foo() or myFunc()).
  - Don't give functions really really over verbose names (e.g. theFunctionToLiftTheArmMechanism()).
  - All of the rules above also apply for variables.
  - NEVER GIVE A VARIABLE A SINGLE LETTER NAME
