# Guidelines
The guidelines for software development with the Blue Crew Robotics Team

### Important rules:
  - When reviewing someones code be respectful
  - If you do not know what the code is doing: 1) read the comments/documentation 2) ask the person who wrote the code 
  - You must explain how to use your code in clean, neat documentation.
  - Know what your code is actually doing! 
  - Commit code to git when you have completed your code and it compiles correctly
  - DON'T COMMIT BROKEN CODE
  - Commit code after finishing one topic (DON'T MOVE FROM TOPIC TO TOPIC WITHOUT COMMITING WORKING CODE)
  
### Code Formatting Guidelines:
  - Use Camel Case for naming functions, variables, commands, and subsystems.
  - Don't ever give a function an arbitrary name (e.g. foo() or myFunc()).
  - Don't give functions really really over verbose names (e.g. theFunctionToLiftTheArmMechanism()).
  - All of the rules above also apply for variables, commands, and subsystems.
  - NEVER GIVE A VARIABLE A SINGLE LETTER NAME!
  - When naming a command always start the name with "Cmd" (e.g. CmdIntakeBall).
  - Name commands as verbs.
  - When naming a subsystem always start the name with "Sub" (e.g. SubElevator).
  - Name subsystems as nouns and only nouns.
